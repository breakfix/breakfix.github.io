When none of the usual paths bore fruit, we began to look into the management software installed on the endpoint, specifically Symantec Management Agent (previously known as “Altiris”). Indeed this was something we had run into before and were keen to see what could be done from a privilege escalation perspective.\nReviewing the online documentation revealed the use of a “Account Connectivity Credential (ACC)”. This account is used to facilitate network access to the Symantec Site Server in order to download package, policy and task configuration data. This immediately reminded us of another three letter acronym used to perform an almost identical task within Microsoft SCCM, the Network Access Account (NAA).\nSecurity risks associated with Network Access Accounts are well established, thanks to excellent research by Adam Chester and C# tooling such as a SharpSCCM by Chris Thompson.\nGiven the frequency with which we see overly privileged SCCM NAAs on engagements, we set off to identify how the Symantec Management Agent ACC was configured, how it was delivered to the endpoint and if it was possible to extract the credentials.\nTo skip straight to the tool, go here https://github.com/mdsecactivebreach/evilaltiris\nSymantec Management Platform Infrastructure The Symantec Management Platform has four main architectural components as detailed here\nNotification Server and its Web-based Symantec Management Console SQL Server Site servers (can include task servers, package servers, network boot servers, and monitor service). Managed computers A high-level infrastructure diagram from Symantec can be seen below. For our purposes, we assume we have already compromised a managed computer with the Symantec Management Agent installed.\nSymantec Management Agent ACC Account Configuration During installation of our lab environment, we are prompted to enter the account credentials for the Notification Server account.\nAccording to the documentation, this account must have local administrator rights on the Notification Server.\nBy default, these credentials will also be used as the ACC unless we explicitly configure one inside the web admin portal under Settings → Agents/Plug-ins → Symantec Management Agent → Settings → Global Agent Settings. This means that in a default configuration, the ACC will be set to an account with full administrative rights over the Notification Server. These credentials can also be used to access the admin console at URL https://notification-server.local/Altiris/console with full admin rights.\nWe can see here that Symantec warn us about the potential security risks associated with this and instead suggest we configure a low-privileged account. Problem solved! surely no-one would use the product in its default configuration?\nWith an understanding of how the ACC is configured, and the prospect of capturing credentials for a highly privileged account, we can move on to figuring out how the ACC is sent to the agents.\nOverview of the Agent Enrollment Process To understand how the ACC is distributed, we must first understand a bit about how the agent enrollment process works.\nAs the agent communications occurs over HTTP(S), we can simply install the agent using the MSI installer and run Wireshark to observe the traffic. Although the agent installer does support HTTP proxies, running the agent traffic via Burp during installation created unexpected results. To view HTTPS communications, we can simply add the private key from the Notification Server SSL certificate to decrypt the traffic.\nWhile installing the agent, we observe a HTTP request to CreateResource.aspx. Although the POST data is raw binary, we assume this is likely some sort of device enrollment request to register the agent with the Notification Server.\nShortly after the enrollment request, we see a HTTP request to GetClientPolicies.aspx with metadata about our enrolled workstation.\nAs the agent service runs as SYSTEM, these requests are performed using negotiate authentication with the domain computer account. Crucially however, we found that when replaying this request using Burp and providing NTLMv2 credentials for a domain user (not computer) account, the server still returned the same binary response data.\nThis indicated that the application was utilising integrated authentication as a method of transport level protection only. There appeared to be no additional application logic to map our authenticating domain user back to a specific GUID. This would come in handy later on.\nBy tweaking the parameters in the request, we were able to work out the minimum parameters required in order to return a successful response.\nBased on this request, we can conclude that in order to authenticate to the Notification Server and request agent policy data we require the following:\nNTLM / Kerberos authentication (for any domain account) GUID TypeGUID Fulfilling the first requirement is not an issue, as we are already running within a domain context on the endpoint. However, we don’t know how the two GUIDs are generated or how they used to authenticate the request. We also currently have no idea how to decode the server response data returned from the GetClientPolicies request. To complete these remaining requirements, we were going to need to dive deeper into the agent itself.\nSymantec Management Agent Tool While researching ways to increase the level of debugging logged by the agent, we found mention of a handy tool distributed by Symantec SMATool.exe. This tool can be found on the Notification Server at C:\\Program Files\\Altiris\\Notification Server\\Bin\\Tools\\SMATool.exe and provides a number of debugging functions for the agent.\nSMATool.exe SMP Agent Command Line Tool Copyright (C) 2023 Broadcom.

Running this from a local administrator prompt on a machine with the agent installed, resulted in the below output.\nSMATool.exe /AGENT DUMP MACHINETYPE Machine type: Virtual Manufacturer: Oracle Corporation Model: VirtualBox Version: 1.2 GUID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 Machine type GUID: {2C3CB3BB-FEE9-48DF-804F-90856198B600} This GUID looks familiar! This is the same value we observed as the TypeGUID argument in our request to GetClientPolicies.aspx. So what about that other GUID we saw, is this also stored in the LDB ? It turns out this is actually stored within the registry, unencrypted and readable by any (low privileged) user.\nComputer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Altiris\\Altiris Agent\\MachineGuid\nWe now have all the information required to request policy data from the Notification Server, although it’s not much use to us as the response data is just raw binary. In turns out, however, that SMAtool has got our back here as well.\nIf we take our response data, convert it to base64 and pass it to the /DATA DUMP PASSWORD function, we are presented with an error “Bad Data”.\nSMATool.exe /DATA DUMP PASSWORD AACJUtjGF Failed to execute command: 0x80090005 [Bad Data]. Further reading of the Symantec documentation reveals this line, which gives us a hint at how the data within the LDB is encrypted.\nSMATool.exe should run under SYSTEM account in order to be able to decrypt the policy response file (use psexec.exe). If we launch a SYSTEM command prompt using PSExec.exe and re-run the command, we are now prompted for a Troubleshooting password.\nSMATool.exe /DATA DUMP PASSWORD AACJUtjGF Type the troubleshooting password: * This is set from within the Notification Server web administration portal and is used by the agent to encrypt certain data stored within the LDB.

</code></pre><p>During our testing we noticed that <code>ACC_SecureAttribute</code> values taken from different environments could all be decrypted using the same <code>SMAtool</code> , however this was not the case for policy data returned from the server. This indicated that policy data was likely encrypted using an agent specific key (stored in the LDB) while the ACC was encrypted using a static key (stored in the <code>SMAtool</code> binary itself). The versatile nature of the <code>SMAtool</code> means that it is able to examine the input string and automatically determine which encryption key to use to decrypt the data.</p><h3 id=exploitation-from-high-privilege>Exploitation from High Privilege<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#exploitation-from-high-privilege>#</a></h3><p>We now have everything we need to recover the ACC credentials from a privileged (SYSTEM) process on a workstation with the Symantec Management Agent installed.

</code></pre><p><strong>Note</strong>: One additional bonus is that the TCP port for both the agent communications and admin web interface are the same (TCP 80/443). This means that network connectivity to the admin web interface from the workstation LAN must be permitted through the firewall due to the requirement to allow traffic from the agent. This is especially useful for hardened environments where server management ports are typically only accessible from specific hosts or jumpboxes.</p><h3 id=exploitation-from-low-privilege>Exploitation from Low Privilege<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#exploitation-from-low-privilege>#</a></h3><p>Although our attack works, we are reliant on SYSTEM access in order to decrypt the required data stored in the <code>LDB</code>. The requirement to write <code>SMATool.exe</code> to disk is also not ideal from an OPSEC perspective. Finally, there is no technical restriction preventing us from performing the attack with a regular domain user account, as any user can authenticate to the Notification Server via NTLM. As a result, we looked to develop an exploitation path from a non-elevated position, removing any reliance on <code>SMATool.exe</code>.</p><p>To achieve this, we needed to validate some of our earlier assumptions around the enrollment process using a combination of de-compilation and dynamic reversing.</p><p>Revisiting our device enrollment request, we wanted to better understand the initial request used to enroll an agent in the Notification Server.</p><p><img alt=image.png loading=lazy src=/altiris/image%201.png></p><p>Although the request body is encrypted, as the back-end code for the Notification Server is written in .NET we can de-compile the server binaries to try and identify how the request data is encrypted.

</code></pre><p>A nice bonus here is that the Notification Server also includes the agent <code>TypeGUID</code> in the response which we will need to request the agent policy data. This is useful because as a low privileged user we are unable to read the <code>TypeGUID</code> value directly due to it being stored encrypted within the <code>LDB</code>. <strong>Note</strong>: The symmetric key included in the response data is not useful to us as it is not used for protecting the policy data.</p><p>The issue with this approach is that once we overwrite the <code>policyKey</code>, the agent will no longer be able to decrypt its own policy requests (as it has no knowledge of the newly generated key). This is less than ideal as it leaves the agent in an unstable state unable to receive future policy updates. Indeed, after overwriting the agent public key we see that an error status is now shown inside the console.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot from 2024-11-18 14-36-26.png" loading=lazy src=/altiris/Screenshot_from_2024-11-18_14-36-26.png></p><p>We spent some time on this trying to find a way to somehow restore the agent after overwriting the existing public key. Late one night, while digging into the Symantec Management Agent COM interface with OleView, we struck gold.</p><p><img alt=image.png loading=lazy src=/altiris/image%209.png></p><p>The Symantec Management Agent service exposes a local COM server <code>AeXNSAgent</code> exporting a number of methods for managing the agent. One of the methods <code>ClearMachineGuid</code> provided the exact functionality we were after. Calling this function causes the agent to make a request to the <code>CreateResource.aspx</code> endpoint with the existing agent metadata (and crucially agent public key value) currently stored within the LDB.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The method name is somewhat of a misnomer, as the <code>machineGuid</code> value won’t really be “cleared”. This is because the <code>machineGuid</code> value is calculated based on the information contained in the request (the hardware of the machine, computer name, MAC address etc). As this information is unlikely to change, the <code>machineGuid</code> value returned by the Notification Server will very likely remain unchanged.</p><p>Calling this method via C# is straightforward using the below code.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>            dynamic comObject = Activator.CreateInstance(Type.GetTypeFromProgID(&#34;Altiris.AeXClient.1&#34;));
            comObject.ClearMachineGuid();         
</code></pre><p>After making this call, we can see the request to <code>CreateResource.aspx</code> is made by the agent.</p><p><img alt=image.png loading=lazy src=/altiris/image%2010.png></p><p>This will restore the <code>policyKey</code> value back to the original public key value stored within the <code>LDB</code> on the agent prior to our exploit. Opening up the console again, we see that the agent is now able to receive data from the Notification Server successfully.</p><p><img alt="Screenshot from 2024-11-18 14-36-38.png" loading=lazy src=/altiris/Screenshot_from_2024-11-18_14-36-38.png></p><h3 id=decrypting-policy-data>Decrypting Policy Data<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#decrypting-policy-data>#</a></h3><p>With knowledge of the <code>MachineGuid</code>, <code>TypeGUID</code> and our attacker controlled public key assigned to the machine, we can now make a request for the agent policy data from the <code>GetClientPolicies.aspx</code> endpoint. As the returned data will be encrypted with our generated public key, we simply need to reverse the encryption process to recover the policy data.</p><p>Reviewing the server-side code, we find the <code>ProcessNodeData</code> function within the <code>Altiris87.NS.dll:Altiris.NS.AgentManagement.AgentDataProtection.cs</code> Class is responsible for generating our policy XML data.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>    private static void ProcessNodeData(

This symmetric key and IV are then added to the <code>enc_header</code> blob which is encrypted with the machine’s public key. This encrypted header is prepended to the encrypted policy XML data and returned to the agent.</p><p>To perform the decryption, we need to parse out the <code>enc_header</code> from the returned policy data, decrypt the header with our machine’s private key, extract the symmetric key and finally decrypt the policy data.</p><pre tabindex=0><code>EvilAltiris.exe decryptpolicy /data:policy.dat /key:&#34;&lt;RSAKeyValue&gt;&lt;TRIMMED FOR BREVITY&gt;&lt;/RSAKeyValue&gt;&#34;

Symantec outline the following best practices for the ACC in their <a href=https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/194234/how-to-setup-agent-connectivity-credenti.html>documentation</a>, specifically:</p><ul><li>Use a Local Account for the ACC, not a Domain Account.</li><li>The new local account must be granted at least READ permissions to the locations where the package files are located such as the Software Library, NSCAP share, and Patch Download location. If these are all on the same Drive, then READ access can be added at the Drive level for simplicity.</li></ul><h3 id=references>References<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#references>#</a></h3><ul><li><p><a href=https://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?79163-Structure-of-HCRYPTKEY-Data>https://forums.codeguru.com/showthread.php?79163-Structure-of-HCRYPTKEY-Data</a><a href=https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/ransomware-in-the-honeypot-how-we-capture-keys>https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/ransomware-in-the-honeypot-how-we-capture-keys</a></p></li><li><p><a href=https://blog.xpnsec.com/unobfuscating-network-access-accounts/>https://blog.xpnsec.com/unobfuscating-network-access-accounts/</a></p></li></ul><p><strong>This article was also posted on <a href=https://www.mdsec.co.uk/2024/12/extracting-account-connectivity-credentials-accs-from-symantec-management-agent-aka-altiris/>mdsec.co.uk</a></strong></p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://breakfix.co/posts/scommand-and-conquer---attacking-system-center-operations-manager/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>SCOMmand And Conquer - Attacking System Center Operations Manager</span>
